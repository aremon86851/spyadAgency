    title: 'Great Choice',
    review: 'We utilize it to recruit talent from imaginative professionals to programmers. For any skill we require or any task too cumbersome to be managed by the in-house team, we subcontract through Facebook. The external team ebbs and flows a bit in response to shifting needs but we also maintain a solid base of freelancers who remain for a few months at a time. Facebook accomplishes what it is intended to do - linking freelancers to clients and it outperforms the alternatives we have experimented with. Even with all its imperfections, if you are in need of a freelancer for any purpose, Facebook stands as a great choice.',

    review: 'LinkedIn is my go-to spot when I need to find freelancers who can take off my daily tasks and that too for just a third of what a regular professional would charge!üè∑Ô∏è The best part is Lindein policies are super updated and they have got my back all the time. It is a win-win for all!üåêüîí I have had disputes in the past and Lenkdein has stepped in and resolved everything fairly keeping my business interest intact. üìú‚öñÔ∏èI would recommend linkedin over any other freelance marketplace. If you have got work that needs doing just post it on LinkedIn and relax. Your job will get done - no worries! üéØüëçüèÅ',

    review: "I'm quite happy with the Campaign service I got on linkdein.  The product shots were so detailed that you could see every feature clearly making it easier for customers to know what they are buying. The lifestyle photos gave a real-life feel showing how the product can be used day to day. The studio shots were super professional and my Amazon listing looks really polished. I'm very pleased with the service I got.",
